Please read the instructions in @gemini_tasks/mortality.md.
We are going to do the work described there.

**Before starting:**
- Think hard to brainstorm clarifying questions
- If you have any such questions, STOP and ask them

**During implementation:**
- Don't get creative with the implementation - copy code approach from file as a starting point
- Feel free to refine code as needed, but STOP if you start deviating from the issue significantly so we can discuss
- Continue until the issue is done and all tests pass
- Run `@clean-code-reviewer` agent on all new/modified code for review
- Use `air format file.R` to format any modified files
